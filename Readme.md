###### FAQ
Q: Why this is now a C# project?

A: I am familiar with C#, and python lacks a decent ORM that isn't a pain to use. Deal with it...

###### Notes
The bot is provided as is and is not guaranteed to work. If you have any issues, please open an issue on the github repo. I might or might not fix it.
You're welcome to fork the repo and make your own changes, but I do not guarantee that I will be accepting your pull request.

This just a pet project and as such it might get abandoned at any time.
